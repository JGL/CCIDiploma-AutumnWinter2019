				<h3>0. Group Meditation</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>TBC.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>1. Questions?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>All questions allowed!</li>
					<li>2 minutes alone on post it notes, then double group size every 1 minutes until it's the whole
						group.</li>
					<li>This idea came from <a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a>. He does this exercise
						at the start of every session of <a href="https://sfpc.io/">School of Poetic Computation in New
							York</a>.</li>
				</ul />

			<section>
				<h3>2. Ant Farm, A Hole in Space and The Secret War between Uploading and Downloading.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Farm_(group)">Ant Farm</a>. <a href="http://spatialagency.net/database/ant.farm">Spatial Agency article</a>. <a href="http://www.ubu.com/film/ant_farm_media.html">Video of Media Burn on Ubuweb</a> - which is a brilliant resource for avant-garde art in general.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.ecafe.com/getty/HIS/index.html">Hole in Space</a> by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSMVtE1QjaU">Video excerpt</a>.</li>
					<li>Great book on media consumption/creation: <a href="http://www.secret-war.com">The Secret War between Uploading and Downloading</a> by <a href="http://www.peterlunenfeld.com">Peter Lunenfeld</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. Genes and Memes and the Alt Right.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene">Genes</a> allow living things to pass on biological information between generations.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Memes</a> allow humans to pass on information between each other, across time.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.zero-books.net/books/kill-all-normies">Kill all Normies</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nagle">Angela Nagle</a> is an interesting book on the spread of online culture into the real world - from 4chan to the "alt-right".</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>4. William Gibson and Atemporality.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks">Iain M. Banks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a> is one of my favourite authors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a> is essential reading, as are the rest of his books.</li>
					<li>Several quotes of his are amongst my favourites: "The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed", "The street finds its own use for things".</li>
					<li>My favourite of all, are his statements on Atemporality: <a href="https://twitter.com/greatdismal/status/1918178571">"Very creative people get atemporal early on. Are relatively unimpressed by the "now" factor, by latest things. Access the whole continuum."</a></li>
				</ul>

			<section>
				<h3>5. Disney eating the Commons and Relational Aesthetics.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It is ironic that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">Disney has continually extended copyright</a> in the United States in order to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/well-probably-never-free-mickey-thats-beside-point">protect Mickey Mouse</a>, as it draws so strongly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">the Commons</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films">many of its films</a>.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_art">Relational Aesthetics</a> was a book written in 1998 by Nicolas Bourriaud that documented the work of artists that wanted to produce work outside of the traditional gallery system, or perhaps work that was impossible to sell. See <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/18426/wtf-is-relational-aesthetics/">"WTF is… Relational Aesthetics?"</a> or the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_Sehgal">Tino Sehgal</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>6. Aaron Swartz, Mark Fisher, Rutger Bregman and Timothy Morton.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> was the co-founder of Reddit, hacker and activist. He was a believer in the Digital Commons. For more about his life, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ">The Internet's Own Boy</a>.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher_%28theorist%29">Mark Fisher</a> was a writer and cultural theorist. His works <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism:_Is_there_no_alternative%3F">Capitalist Realism: Is there no alternative?</a> and <a href="https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-weird-and-the-eerie/">The Weird and the Eerie</a> have been particularly useful to me.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_for_Realists_(book)">Utopia for Realists</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman">Rutger Bregman</a> is another book that I would recommend, in a similar vein.</li>
					<li>Finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton">Timothy Mortons</a> <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/hyperobjects">Hyperobjects</a> has been very helpful to think of more effective ways of thinking about Global Warming.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>7. The EM Spectrum, how long a nanosecond is, Hedy Lamarr and Frequency Hopping.</h3>
				<ul>
