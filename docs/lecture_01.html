				<h3>0. Introductions.</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>What do you like to be called?</li>
					<li>How did you get to college today?</li>
					<li>How are you feeling today in one word?</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>1. Questions?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>What questions do you have?</li>
					<li>What are your concerns? What are you worried about? What do you want to ask but you are
						embarrassed?</li>
					<li>All questions allowed!</li>
					<li>20 minutes alone on post it notes, then double group size every 10 minutes until it's the whole
						group.</li>
					<li>This idea came from <a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a>. He does this exercise
						at the start of every session of <a href="https://sfpc.io/">School of Poetic Computation in New
							York</a>.</li>
				</ul />

				<h3>2. My motivations and my aims for the next year. (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Let's start with a presesention I gave at <a href="https://aho.no/en/">AHO in Oslo</a> at the
						start of
						September,
						2019: <a
							href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/presentations/AHOPresentationMotivations2019/#/">Motivations,
							Positions,
							Approaches</a></li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>2. My motivations and my aims for the next year. (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Brain exploding and some coding.</li>
					<li>I'm going to reference <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> a lot in this
						course, because I think it's one of the best things that humanity has ever made, and I wish
						I'd had it when I was young. Also it's free - I hated it when teachers would reference books
						that I couldn't afford when I was at university.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>2. My motivations and my aims for the next year (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I only ask that you pay attention and ask questions if you have them. I'd really encourage
						you to take the time to watch the films and read the references I put up. Think of them as
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#Cheat_codes">cheat codes</a>
						to get you to the next level quicker than I did.</li>
					<li>To <b>introduce</b> lots of interesting concepts from many areas so that you know the magic
						word to search for if you want to know more. <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">Obfuscation</a> is a BIG problem.</li>
					<li>To teach you how to code, to start you on that path and point you in the
						right direction.</li>
					<li>To teach the history of creative computing, and by extension, computing, creativity and
						everything (-;.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>2. My motivations and my aims for the next year (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To teach you see problems at many levels (<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems
						(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>),
						find the order in them (<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern
							recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you
						might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
					<li>Most of all, to <b>teach</b> you to be <b>autodidacts</b>, and, as previously mentioned, to
						blow your mind <b>at least</b> once per lecture.</li>
					<li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>2. My motivations and my aims for the next year (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm inspired by other people the most.</li>
					<li>Here are <a
							href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/g7916/best-female-artists/">some
							artists</a>. Have you heard of them before?</li>
					<li>Here are <a href="https://www.courses.tegabrain.com/CC17/list-of-artists/">some more
							artists</a>. Have you
						heard of them before?</li>
					<li>I'm still learning. Just like you.</li>
					<li>You are not children, just less experienced (in some things!) than me. That's it.</li>
					<li>My name is Joel, please call me that. Not Sir or Mr.Lewis or anything else. Apart from Cyber or
						JGL.</li>
					<li>This year I want to get better at 3D software - does anyone know about that? Does anyone know <a
							href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>?</li>
				</ul>

				</ul>
			</section>

				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions...</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Taking some inspiration from the Bauhaus, I think materiality is interesting. What does
						materiality mean? I hear it all the time at universities.</li>
					<li>The Bauhaus also had the best parties, do we want to do that too?</li>
					<li>This year is not a break, it's about practice. We ared going to do projects all the time. What
						do you want to make? What are the issues that matter to you? Why do they matter to you?</li>
					<li>What kind of utopia do you want? I think I want university everywhere, forever, for everyone.
						Sometimes teaching, sometimes learning.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.caitlinmorris.net/">Caitlin Morris</a> has some advice for you all:
						<blockquote cite="http://www.caitlinmorris.net/">
							"Remind students that technical exercises can be the root of a bigger idea. I’ve had
							students submit small
							sketches along with their introductory exercises under the prompt of “if I worked on this
							for another
							month/year, what
							could it become?”. Some really beautiful ideas emerge and I’ve found that it makes students
							more
							concept-attentive in their weekly projects, as well as providing some groundwork for larger
							final projects."
						</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I think this is great advice for how to make progress to bigger goals:<img
							src="img/HenrikKnibergCarDiagram.jpg" width="50%"></li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You are going to go further faster than anyone else here.</li>
					<li>Faster than the BSc, the MSc, the PhD's or the staff.</li>
					<li>The reason is that you already have a practice.</li>
					<li>Creative computing knowledge can be applied to ANY practice. See the <a
							href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computational-thinking">MIT Computational Thinking
							book</a> to see how
						researchers in many fields are learning computational knowledge that even computer scientists
						don't use, as
						they don't have the orginal subject knowledge.</li>
					<li>Do we have any textiles people here? Textlies is the beginning of computing! The Jacquard Loom
						was the first programmable object. Also, Annie Albers is one of my favourite artists. How could
						we be inspired by her practice?</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Again, that MIT Computational Thinking book has a large section about the importance of
						computing to every area
						of science. I want to prove that for craft and design and art.</li>
					<li>Do you want to do the same? This is what we are all here to do.</li>
					<li>We are now a community.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Introduction exercise: "Name Circle".</li>
					<li>Energy exercise: "Clap Circle".</li>
					<li>Do you know any more of these? Send me them if you do.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Circle is always the way I want to do things when we discuss, but I’m going to bend it into a
						half circle when I do presentations, but I’m going to sit in the middle.</li>
					<li> Sit where you like on chairs or on the floor or whatever. If you need to go to the bathroom or
						take a movement
						it’s fine, you don’t have to ask.</li>
					<li> Please silence
						your devices so everyone else finds it easier to pay attention. Saying that, I actively
						encourage you to use
						devices when you are in this community whenever you want to.</li>
					<li>Part of what you are going to do together is to
						write notes on what is going on so you can share them.</li>
					<li>It’s up to you to organise things.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> I’m going to record
						my screen and camera as a backup, which you can use if you want. Come to me if you want video
						files
						on the
						Slack.</li>
					<li>I will also post my lecture slides, they will always be online on the Github. That’s how
						I’m
						delivering
						them now.</li>
					<li>The complete slides for the course aren’t available yet as they don’t exist. I’m going to
						write as we
						go because this is the first time that this is happening.</li>
					<li>I need you to help future <b>DIPLOMATS</b>!</li>
					<li>What
						do we call
						ourselves? What is our motto? Secret handshake?</li>
					<li>It’s up to us in this community to make it kind. I need your help to do that.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is the primary means of communication for this course.
					</li>
					<li>Everyone say hi to me in <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>!</li>
					<li>If you want to use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> to build a document for the lecture
						that’s fine. Or
						<a href="docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>? Or <a
							href="https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/Sites-that-run-Etherpad-Lite">EtherPad</a>?

				<h3>3. What are your aims for the next year? Some suggestions... (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I want someone who doesn't have a GitHub ID to pair up with someone who has and the person who
						has show the person who hasn't how to sign up. Everyone do that. Give me your usernames on the
						Slack when you have done it and I'll add you to the GitHub project for the whole term.</li>
					<li>Which companies do you want to visit? You must perfect moving as a silent unit! You could make a
						patch to thank
						people you visit? See <a href="http://paglen.com/?l=work&s=symbology">Trevor Paglen's Symbology
							work</a> for some inspiration.</li>

					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>5. Copying/Plagarism (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The main thing I take from it is this section:<blockquote>"Throughout your studies, you will be
							encouraged to reference the
							work of other artists, writers, designers or performers in your work. Tutors will expect to
							find reference to
							the sources of your ideas in supporting documentation such as sketchbooks or initial drafts.
							This is an
							essential and valuable part of your education. <b>As long as the source of the ideas is
								acknowledged, this is not
								plagiarism</b>."</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>6. Some artists: Agnes Martin, Anni Albers, Lilian Schwarz, Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>What follows are a few artists that I love and think that you might be interested in. There are
						many more, as
						we saw earlier.</li>
					<li>Perhaps a page of references might be an interesting page to add to the wiki?</li>

				<ul>
					<li>What is Practice?</li>
					<li>When I thought about it, it helped me alot.</li>
					<li>I like it because the word has many meanings, like many words. What meanings does it have for
						you? Have you head it at UAL alot?</li>
					<li>What is a practice? What is your practice? What is the question that moves you in a direction?
						Or in no direction?

				<h3>9. Counting in decimal, unary and binary.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Counting is using groups of symbols to represent quantities or amounts.</li>

				<h3>10. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Computers use binary to represent everything in <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</a>.</li>
					<li>A bit is a Binary digIT.</li>
					<li>A byte is eight bits. (BEight).</li>
					<li>A kilobyte is 1,024 (2^10) bytes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte">mostly</a>.
					</li>
					<li>A megabyte is 1,048,576 (2^20) bytes, <a

				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>10. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>One megabyte is approximately one minute of 128 kbit/s MP3 compressed music.</li>
					<li>One megabyte is six seconds of uncompressed CD audio.</li>
					<li>One megabyte is a typical English book volume in plain text format (500 pages × 2000
						characters per page).</li>
					<li>The human genome consists of DNA representing 800 MB of data. The parts that differentiate
						one person from another can be compressed to 4 MB!</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>10. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>There are different ways of storing numbers and words in computers, as whole these values
						are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">Data types</a>.</li>
					<li>Whole numbers or Integers are stored as <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29">ints</a>. E.g. 0, 5,
						-567.</li>
					<li>Numbers which are in between whole numbers are stored as <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">Floating Points or
							floats</a>. E.g. 3.142 or -5.66343.</li>
					<li>As these numbers are stored in certain amounts of memory, if they get too big (or negative,
						or precise) the computer can run out of memory to store them, or overflow. This is bad. See
						the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K bug</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>10. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You can also store individual characters of the alphabet as <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)">chars</a>.</li>
					<li>However, there are different encodings of characters - <a

				<h3>11. How big things are.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Thanks to <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/10298">Terrence J. Sejnowski and his
							article on Edge.org</a> for the following examples.</li>
					<li>How many seconds are there in a lifetime? 10^9 seconds.</li>
					<li><q>A second is an arbitrary time unit, but one that is based on our experience. Our visual
							system is bombarded by snapshots at a rate of around 3 per second caused by rapid eye
							movements called saccades. Athletes often win or lose a race by a fraction of a second.
							If you earned a dollar for every second in your life you would be a billionaire.
							However, a second can feel like a minute in front of an audience and a quiet weekend can
							disappear in a flash. As a child, a summer seemed to last forever, but as an adult,
							summer is over almost before it begins. William James speculated that subjective time
							was measured in novel experiences, which become rarer as you get older. Perhaps life is
							lived on a logarithmic time scale, compressed toward the end.</q></li>

				<h3>11. How big things are (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>What is the GDP of the world? $10^14.</li>
					<li><q>A billion dollars was once worth a lot, but there is now a long list of
							multibillionaires. The US government recently stimulated the world economy by loaning
							several trillion dollars to banks. It is difficult to grasp how much a trillion dollars
							($10^12) represents, but several clever videos on YouTube (key words: trillion dollars)
							illustrate this with physical comparisons (a giant pile of $100 bills) and what you can
							buy with it (10 years of US response to 9/11). When you start thinking about the world
							economy, the trillions of dollars add up. A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon
							your talking about real money. But so far there aren't any trillionaires.</q></li>

				<h3>11. How big things are (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How many synapses are there in the brain? 10^15.</li>
					<li><q>Two neurons can communicate with each other at a synapse, which is the computational unit
							in the brain. The typical cortical synapse is less than a micron in diameter (10^-6
							metres), near the resolution limit of the light microscope. If the economy of the world
							is a stretch for us to contemplate, thinking about all the synapses in your head is mind
							boggling. If I had a dollar for every synapse in your brain I could support the current
							economy of the world for 10 years. Cortical neurons on average fire once a second, which
							implies a bandwidth of around 10^15 bits per second, greater than the total bandwidth of
							the internet backbone.</q></li>

				<h3>11. How big things are (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How many seconds will the sun shine? 10^17 seconds</li>
					<li><q>Our sun has shined for billions of years and will continue to shine for billions more.
							The universe seems to be standing still during our lifetime, but on longer time scales
							the universe is filled with events of enormous violence. The spatial scales are also
							immense. Our space-time trajectory is a very tiny part of the universe, but we can at
							least attach powers of 10 to it and put it into perspective.</q></li>
