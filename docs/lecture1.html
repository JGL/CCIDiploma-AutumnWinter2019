					<h3>0. Introduce myself.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Born in London, grew up in Wales on a mountain.</li>
						<li>BSc in Maths and Computer Science at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial</a>, MA
							in Interaction Design at <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/">Royal College of Art</a>.</li>
						<li>One year at <a href="http://www.fabrica.it/">Fabrica</a>.</li>
						<li>Three years at <a href="http://uva.co.uk/">UnitedVisualArtists</a>.</li>
						<li>Eight years at <a href="https://vimeo.com/hellicarandlewis">Hellicar&Lewis</a>.</li>
						<li>Three years of teaching at CSM and RCA and <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/">working on
								my own projects</a>.</li>
						<li>Watch this space... (-;</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1. The aim of this course.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Brain exploding and some coding.</li>
						<li>I'm going to reference <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> a lot in this
							course, because I think it's one of the best things that humanity has ever made, and I wish
							I'd had it when I was young. Also it's free - I hated it when teachers would reference books
							that I couldn't afford when I was at university.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1. The aim of this course (continued)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I only ask that you pay attention and ask questions if you have them. I'd really encourage
							you to take the time to watch the films and read the references I put up. Think of them as
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#Cheat_codes">cheat codes</a>
							to get you to the next level quicker than I did.</li>
						<li>To <b>introduce</b> lots of interesting concepts from many areas so that you know the magic
							word to search for if you want to know more. <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">Obfuscation</a> is a BIG problem.</li>
						<li><b>Not</b> to teach you how to code, but to start you on that path and point you in the
							right direction.</li>
						<li><b>Not</b> to teach the history of art, computing or graphic design.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1. The aim of this course (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>To teach you see problems at many levels (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems
							(<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>),
							find the order in them (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern
								recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you
							might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
						<li>Most of all, to <b>teach</b> you to be <b>autodidacts</b>, and, as previously mentioned, to
							blow your mind <b>at least</b> once per lecture.</li>
						<li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>2. Counting in decimal, unary and binary.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Counting is using groups of symbols to represent quantities or amounts.</li>
						<li>Let's count to 100 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">Decimal</a>. When do
							we need a extra digits?</li>
						<li>Let's count to 10 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">Unary</a>.
						</li>
						<li>Let's count to 20 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Binary</a>. When
							do we need an extra digit?</li>
						<li>What's the biggest number you can count to on your fingers? On your fingers and toes?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Computers use binary to represent everything in <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</a>.</li>
						<li>A bit is a Binary digIT.</li>
						<li>A byte is eight bits. (BEight).</li>
						<li>A kilobyte is 1,024 (2^10) bytes, <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte">mostly</a>.</li>
						<li>A megabyte is 1,048,576 (2^20) bytes, <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte">mostly</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>One megabyte is approximately one minute of 128 kbit/s MP3 compressed music.</li>
						<li>One megabyte is six seconds of uncompressed CD audio.</li>
						<li>One megabyte is a typical English book volume in plain text format (500 pages Ã— 2000
							characters per page).</li>
						<li>The human genome consists of DNA representing 800 MB of data. The parts that differentiate
							one person from another can be compressed to 4 MB!</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>There are different ways of storing numbers and words in computers, as whole these values
							are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">Data types</a>.</li>
						<li>Whole numbers or Integers are stored as <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29">ints</a>. E.g. 0, 5,
							-567.</li>
						<li>Numbers which are in between whole numbers are stored as <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">Floating Points or
								floats</a>. E.g. 3.142 or -5.66343.</li>
						<li>As these numbers are stored in certain amounts of memory, if they get too big (or negative,
							or precise) the computer can run out of memory to store them, or overflow. This is bad. See
							the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K bug</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3. Memory in computers, storing numbers and words (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>You can also store individual characters of the alphabet as <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)">chars</a>.</li>
						<li>However, there are different encodings of characters - <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> and <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> for example - which allow
							different character sets to be displayed.</li>
						<li>You can store words (multiple characters) in strings - which are actually just lists of
							chars.</li>
						<li>Another name for lists are <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">arrays</a>.</li>
						<li>Strings are one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension">dimensional</a> arrays.
							We'll be discussing two dimensional arrays next time.</li>
						<li>Data can be stored as fixed values (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(computer_programming)">constants</a>) or
							values that can change (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29">variables</a>).
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>4. How big things are.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Thanks to <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/10298">Terrence J. Sejnowski and his
								article on Edge.org</a> for the following examples.</li>
						<li>How many seconds are there in a lifetime? 10^9 seconds.</li>
						<li><q>A second is an arbitrary time unit, but one that is based on our experience. Our visual
								system is bombarded by snapshots at a rate of around 3 per second caused by rapid eye
								movements called saccades. Athletes often win or lose a race by a fraction of a second.
								If you earned a dollar for every second in your life you would be a billionaire.
								However, a second can feel like a minute in front of an audience and a quiet weekend can
								disappear in a flash. As a child, a summer seemed to last forever, but as an adult,
								summer is over almost before it begins. William James speculated that subjective time
								was measured in novel experiences, which become rarer as you get older. Perhaps life is
								lived on a logarithmic time scale, compressed toward the end.</q></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>4. How big things are (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>What is the GDP of the world? $10^14.</li>
						<li><q>A billion dollars was once worth a lot, but there is now a long list of
								multibillionaires. The US government recently stimulated the world economy by loaning
								several trillion dollars to banks. It is difficult to grasp how much a trillion dollars
								($10^12) represents, but several clever videos on YouTube (key words: trillion dollars)
								illustrate this with physical comparisons (a giant pile of $100 bills) and what you can
								buy with it (10 years of US response to 9/11). When you start thinking about the world
								economy, the trillions of dollars add up. A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon
								your talking about real money. But so far there aren't any trillionaires.</q></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>4. How big things are (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>How many synapses are there in the brain? 10^15.</li>
						<li><q>Two neurons can communicate with each other at a synapse, which is the computational unit
								in the brain. The typical cortical synapse is less than a micron in diameter (10^-6
								metres), near the resolution limit of the light microscope. If the economy of the world
								is a stretch for us to contemplate, thinking about all the synapses in your head is mind
								boggling. If I had a dollar for every synapse in your brain I could support the current
								economy of the world for 10 years. Cortical neurons on average fire once a second, which
								implies a bandwidth of around 10^15 bits per second, greater than the total bandwidth of
								the internet backbone.</q></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>4. How big things are (continued).</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>How many seconds will the sun shine? 10^17 seconds</li>
						<li><q>Our sun has shined for billions of years and will continue to shine for billions more.
								The universe seems to be standing still during our lifetime, but on longer time scales
								the universe is filled with events of enormous violence. The spatial scales are also
								immense. Our space-time trajectory is a very tiny part of the universe, but we can at
								least attach powers of 10 to it and put it into perspective.</q></li>
