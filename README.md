Golan Levin also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When communicating, ask yourself:
>
> - T – is it True?
> - H – is it Helpful?
> - I – is it Inspiring?
> - N – is it Necessary?
> - K – is it Kind?

## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

At the end of this block (midway through term 2) you should have the following outcomes, with subheadings for methods and platforms we will use to do so. To be clear, I want you to obtain knowledge and then use that to make projects. My aim is to have every student graduate with new creative computing core knowledge and a portfolio of projects that relate that new creative computing knowledge to their chosen BA subject elsewhere at University of the Arts London (UAL).

### Unit 1 / Block 1: "Creative coding and creative computing frameworks"

1. Code creative computing assets in relevant languages (_Knowledge_, _Process_)

- [JavaScript](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

2. Understand the use of key frameworks for creative computing (_Knowledge_, _Process_)

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/)

3. Use online tools to collaborate and support your creative computing projects (_Enquiry_, _Communication_)

- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/)

### Unit 3 / Block 1: "Creative Practice: Visual coding and physical computing"

1. Code interactive visuals (_Process_, _Realisation_)

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

- discussions

## Block/Term Structure

During the first half of term 1, Unit 1 and 3 teaching will be intermingled, in order to make most efficient use of our time.

During the second half of term 1, Unit 1 will be taught on Mondays by me, with Unit 3 being taught on Tuesdays by [Julia Makivic](https://juliamakivic.com/).

[Unit 2 (Computational Futures and AI)](https://github.com/fefegha/Computational-Futures-And-AI) will be taught throughout by [Alex Fefegha](https://www.comuzi.xyz/).

The first half of term two will be spent doing rehersals and mocks for presentations and exams. We will then move on to block 2, units 4, 5 and 6.

## Weekly Structure (first half of term 1)

Monday morning: lectures and discussions Monday afternoon: homework Tuesday morning: lectures and discussions Tuesday afternoon: homework, my office hours

## Weekly Structure (second half of term 1, week 7 onwards inclusive)

Monday morning: lectures on Mathematics and programming. Monday afternoon: visits, talks and seminars Tuesday morning: physical computing lectures Tuesday afternoon: continued physical computing lectures and my office hours.

## Assessment

~~Throughout the term, you will be working in pairs. This is a technique known as [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). You may change pair partner as often or sparingly as you like.~~

Following the <a href="https://twitter.com/helenbevan/status/1175650749797167104?s=11">latest research</a>, I've decided to shift us from pairs to threes. After all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np0YIaHv6LQ">three is a magic number</a>.

However, at the end of block 1 (halfway through term 2), you will be assessed individually. Unit 1 and Unit 3 are assessed in different ways:

- Unit 1 - "Creative coding and creative computing frameworks" - this unit will be assessed in two ways - via multiple choice test and practical coding exam. In the multiple choice test you will be presented with a series of questions relating explicitly to course content. You must choose between up to 4 potentially correct answers per question. In the Practical Exam you will be individually asked to write a basic program to demonstrate the application of creative coding to a set problem. Each part is worth 50% of the unit mark. You will be given 1 hour to complete 20 multiple choice questions. You will be given 2 hours to complete the practical coding exam.
- Unit 3 - "Creative Practice: Visual coding and physical computing" - this unit will be assessed via the presentation of a project that you will work towards throughout the first term and half of the second. This unit is about putting skills from Unit 1 (and others) to use in a project. You will be assessed on your presentation and the ‘slide deck’ from the presentation, which may contain elements you didn't present. You will be given 5 minutes to present, with 5 minutes of discussion.

## Homework Projects

In addition to the formal assessment at the end of the term, I will be setting weekly homework projects. We will discuss and work on the weekly projects on Monday and Tuesday afternoons. The weekly homework projects won't be assessed, but will be in your interest to complete.

The homework projects will be based on exercises from _Code as Creative Medium: An educator's handbook_ by [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/) and [Tega Brain](http://tegabrain.com/).

Remember that small, short, technical exercises can be the root of much bigger ideas and projects that could last a lifetime.
