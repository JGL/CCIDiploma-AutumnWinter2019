## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

At the end of this term you should have the following outcomes, with subheadings for methods and platforms we will use to do so. To be clear be clear I want you to obtain knowledge and then use that to make projects. My aim is to have every student graduate with core knowledge and a portfolio of projects that relate that new knowledge to what they knew before they came to the course.

## Term Structure

During the first half of the term, Unit 1 and 3 teaching will be intermingled, in order to make most efficient use of our time.

During the second half of the term, Unit 1 will be taught on Monday mornings, with Unit 3 being taught on Tuesday mornings.

## Weekly Structure

Monday morning: lectures and discussions
Monday afternoon: visits, talks and seminars
Tuesday morning: lectures and discussions
Tuesday afternoon: workshops, homework and project work, my office hours

## Assessment

Throughout the term, you will be working in pairs. This is a technique known as [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). You may change pair partner as often or sparingly as you like.

However, at the end of term, you will be assessed individually. Unit 1 and Unit 3 are assessed in different ways:

- Unit 1 - "Creative coding and creative computing frameworks" - this unit will be assessed in two ways - via multiple choice test and practical exam. In the multiple choice test you will be presented with a series of questions relating explicitly to course content. You must choose between up to 4 potentially correct answers per question. In the Practical Exam you will be individually asked to write a basic program to demonstrate the application of creative coding to a set problem. Each part is worth 50% of the unit mark.
- Unit 3 - "Creative Practice: Visual coding and physical computing" - this unit will be assessed via the presentation of a project that you will work towards throughout this first term. This unit is about putting skills from Unit 1 (and others) to use in a project. You will be assessed on your presentation and the ‘slide deck’ from the presentation.

## Homework Projects

In addition to the formal assessment at the end of the term, I will be setting weekly homework projects. We will discuss and work on these weekly projects on Monday and Tuesday afternoons, in addition to talks, discussions and visits to museums, galleries, places and studios. These weekly homework projects won't be assessed, but will be in your interest to complete.

These homework projects will be based on projects and exercises from *Code as Creative Medium: An Educator’s Handbook* by [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/) and [Tega Brain](http://tegabrain.com/).

Remember that small, short, technical exercises can be the root of much bigger ideas and projects that could last a lifetime.

## Week 1 (week 39 of 52, commencing Monday 23rd September 2019) - TBCduction and Remembering

### Monday - TBCduction
- Present my goals, for myself in general and the course. Why I am here. Show initial presentation on me: https://joelgethinlewis.com/presentations/ AHOPresentationMotivations2019
- What kind of utopia would you want? I think I'd like a global university.
- I'm still learning too. You are not kids, you are just less experienced (in some things) than me. That's it. My name is Joel, please call me that. Not Sir or Mr.Lewis or anything else. Apart from Cyber or JGL.
- This year I want to get better at 3D modelling - does anyone know about this? Anyone use blender?
- Questions? What do you want to get out of this course? Why are you here? - via Zach "One thing I like to do at School for Poetic Computation is an excercise at the start of the semester where everyone writes down all  the questions they have that brought them into the room.  This starts as s solitary exercise but then we form groups and collect and organize these questions collectively." 30 minutes for first questions on post it notes
- Bauhaus thinking - "Albers - materiality, form follows function, working with paper (seen as a wrapping material at the time), taught the TBC course / foundation, This year is not a break, it’s about practice. We are going to do projects. What do you want to make? What are the issues that matter to you? Why do they matter to you?"
- Caitlin Morris "Remind students that technical exercises can be the root of a bigger idea. I’ve had students submit small sketches along with their TBC exercises under the prompt of “if I worked on this for another month/year, what could it become?”. Some really beautiful ideas emerge and I’ve found that it makes students more concept-attentive in their weekly projects, as well as providing some groundwork for larger final projects." - show HenrikKnibergCarDiagram.jpg
- Also they had the best parties, do we want to do that too?
- Also ask the individual students what they can bring from their subjects. Bring that into the discussion. Textiles students and Annie Albers. Bring the Computational thinking book to the fore from mit - as in the Computational thinking relevant to their craft/subject.
- TBCductions, who are we?
- Show SisterCoritaKentsRulesForArtCollege.jpg
- Show all my desktop inspiration images
- Which companies do they want to visit? They have to perfect moving as a silent unit. They should prepare gifts/badges/patches to say thank you. Show the book from Trevor Paglen.
- Which galleries do they want to visit?
- They are going to produce the wiki for the course, They are going to make notes and share them together, I will also add content to the wiki. There will be prizes for best writer, editor, illustrator, photographer, videographer, musician and influencer/hype person.
- Do the wiki bit, Show them how I’m doing it, Show them how I’ll add them to the project and give them edit access,Ask someone to make a username there and then and take over? Everyone? Ask them all to make github user ids at the beginning of the session, in a nonchalant  way?
- Do we want to do social media? What is our CoC? From p5js? Show that lower down this page.
- Ethics! Show CassieRobinsonThoughts.jpg
- Discuss plagiarism and how to copy and accredit code when incorporating it into your work. Many students will copy and paste code into their work. Often this isn't intended as plagiarism. It can be a grey line on how much of someone else's algorithm needs to be changed to qualify as new work. It's also cultural. Comments! Reference your work. Show JarmuschQuote.jpg
- Really big numbers
- What about a retreat? In shoredham in kent - at the https://thequadrangle.co/
- What is practice? What is my practice? What do you practice?
- the future presentation by me...
- I'd like to set up an audio reactive visual posse/crew/gang that start doing visuals for club nights and the like, lets start running our own!
- show 2019_09_11_PeterRiceOnChoosingToWorkForArup.mov - man has won over nature (has he?) now we have to manage it
- how to crit well, https://twitter.com/rgordon/status/1159276903670439937 - vimeo.com/38247060 - Crits on post it notes and given to student after
Never touch the students computer, tell them that
- reading list - try library genesis? libgen.me - for try before you buy - but please do via amazon links...nothing like a real book

Golan Levin also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When speaking, ask yourself:
>
> * T – is it True?
> * H – is it Helpful?
> * I – is it Inspiring?
> * N – is it Necessary?
> * K – is it Kind?
